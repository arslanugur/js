"There's someone in my head, but it's not me" - Pink Floyd

First, we need to add the React library as two script tags to the head of our HTML document:

  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script> 

Next, we need to add another script, to enable the use of JSX.
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript, and it is recommended to be used with React.
For now, let's just add the following script tag:

  <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script> 


Adding JavaScript into an HTML Document:✨ 
You can add JavaScript code in an HTML document by employing the dedicated HTML tag <script> that wraps around JavaScript code. 
The <script> tag can be placed in the <head> section of your HTML, in the <body> section, or after the </body> close tag, depending on when you want the JavaScript to load. 
Generally, JavaScript code can go inside of the document <head> section in order to keep them contained and out of the main content of your HTML document. 
However, if your script needs to run at a certain point within a page’s layout — like when using document.write to generate content — you should put it at the point where it should be called, usually within the <body> section.

# What Is JSX? 
JSX is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript/React code. 
The syntax is intended to be used by preprocessors (i.e., transpilers like Babel) to transform HTML-like text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript objects that a JavaScript engine will parse. 
Basically, by using JSX you can write concise HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM like tree structures) in the same file as you write JavaScript code, then Babel will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. 
Unlike the past, instead of putting JavaScript into HTML, JSX allows us to put HTML into JavaScript.

Don't think of JSX as a template but instead as a special/alternative JS syntax that has to be compiled. 
I.e., JSX is simply converting XML-like markup into JavaScript.

# CDN
what would be the pro and cons of using CDN links instead of npm?
caching - your browser will need to download these scripts from CDN only ones and chances are you already have them downloaded by other site visited earlier using the same react scripts. 
It improves loading time of your site.
