Selecting Elements
      //All HTML elements are objects. And as we know every object has properties and methods.
      //The document object has methods that allow you to select the desired HTML element.
      //These three methods are the most commonly used for selecting HTML elements: 

document.getElementById(id) //finds element by id

document.getElementsByClassName(name) //finds elements by class name

document.getElementsByTagName(name) //finds elements by tag name
