JavaScript Comments
      We know about statements, these are the instructions within our program that get "executed" when the program runs.
      But! Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
      Any code after a double slash //, or between /* and */, is treated as a comment, and will be ignored, and not executed.

      To write a Single line comment we use double slashes. Like this:
// This is a single line comment
alert("This is an alert box!");

      But why write code that is never going to be executed. Isnâ€™t that a waste of time?
      Not at all! 
      Comments are a good idea, especially ones relating to large functions, as they help make our code more readable for others. 

      alert() is used to create a message box.
      
Multiple-Line Comments
      What if we have more to say?

      If we want to create a multi-line comment, we write it between /*and */
      Like this:
/* This code 
   creates an 
   alert box */
alert("This is an alert box!");

      We use comments to describe and explain what the code is doing.
