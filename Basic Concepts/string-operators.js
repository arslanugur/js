String Operators
      //Concatenation:
      //We can use concatenation (represented by the + sign) to build strings made up of multiple smaller strings, 
      //or by joining strings with other types. Check it out:
var mystring1 = "I am learning ";
var mystring2 = "JavaScript.";
document.write(mystring1 + mystring2);

      //Numbers in quotes are treated as strings: 
      //So "42" is not the number 42, itâ€™s a string that includes the two separate characters, 4 and 2. 

var first=7; 
var second=8; 
document.write(first+second); //output: 15 

var first="7"; 
var second="8"; 
document.write(first+second); //output: 78

var x = "50";
var y = "100";
document.write(x+y); //output: 50100

      //Which of these names are acceptable for JavaScript variables? 
  _module //Underscore is allowed
  firstNumber
