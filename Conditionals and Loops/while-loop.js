The While Loop
      //Time to move on to the second of our three loop statements, while.

      //The while loop repeats through a block of code, but only as long as a specified condition is true.

      //Here's the syntax:
while (condition) {    
   code block
}
      //The condition can be any conditional statement that returns true or false.
