      //This is 6 because x++ is used after while checks its value. 
      //So as we hit 5 while says well we are still lower than 6 so I will just keep going. 
      //Then x++ comes along and turns 5 into 6. 
      //So now that while checks again and says hey this is not less than 6. 
      //It's equal to 6. I must be done. document.write(x);
      
      //Situation1 var x = 0; while(x<6) { document.write(x); x++; } Output => 012345 
      //Situation2 var x = 0; while(x<6) { x++; document.write(x); } Output => 123456 
      //Situation3 var x = 0; while(x<6) { x++; } document.write(x); Output => 6
