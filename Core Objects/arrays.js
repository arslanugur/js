Arrays
      //Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.

      //To store three course names, you need three variables.

      //Example:
var course1 ="HTML"; 
var course2 ="CSS"; 
var course3 ="JS"; 

      //But what if you had 500 courses? The solution is an array
var courses = new Array("HTML", "CSS", "JS"); 

      //This syntax declares an array named courses, which stores three values, or elements.
