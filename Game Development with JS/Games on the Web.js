// JavaScript is a programming language for the web.

// It can be used to create interactive elements, build drop down menus, handle button click events, and much more!
// In our course we will use JavaScript to draw shapes, graphics as well as to create animations.


// Benefits of HTML
// This is possible because it runs in the browser, like a simple website.
// Most modern browsers support the functionality that we will use, making our games run even on mobile devices!

/* 
Here are some of the things we will learn in this course:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript basics
- Drawing on the web
- Animations
- Game Loops
- Collision Detection
- & much more! */



// HTML Basics
  // HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. A markup language uses tags to identify content.
  // Here is an example of an HTML tag:
<p> I'm a paragraph </p>
  // <p> is the tag used to create a paragraph of text. 

// Tags
  // Most tags have an opening and a closing tag, with the content being placed between them.
  // For example, the <p> paragraph tag needs to have a closing tag </p>. 
  // The closing tag is created using a forward slash /.
  // <Opening Tag> Content </Closing Tag>

// to create 'Basic HTML Document Structure'
  // There are many different tags in HTML that serve their purpose.
  // A basic HTML document on the web has the following structure: 
<html>
   <body>
   </body>
</html>

  // The <html> tag defines the page, 
  // while the <body> tag defines the main content of the HTML document and contains all the elements of the page, such as paragraphs, tables, lists, etc.


// HTML Headings
  // Now, let's look at some of the basic elements that we can create.
  // Headings are used to create titles and sub-titles on a page.
  // HTML includes six levels of headings, which are ranked according to importance.
  // These are <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>.

  // The following code defines all of the headings:
<html>
    <head>
        <title>first page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>  # The Largest Heading
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
        <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
        <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
        <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
    </body>
</html>
  // The most used headings are h1, h2 and h3. Don't use headings to make the text big or bold. 
  // Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. So use it wisely


// Paragraphs
  // As we have seen before, paragraphs are created using the <p> tag.
  // We can have multiple <p> tags on our page: 
<h1>My Game</h1>
<p>This is fun</p>
<p>This is another text</p>


// Line Break
  // Some HTML elements have no closing tag.
  // For example, the <br /> tag is used to add a line break: The above code creates a paragraph of text that includes a line
<p>
Name: Player 1 <br />
Points: 42
</p>
  // The above code creates a paragraph of text that includes a line break. 
  // As you can see, HTML tags can be included in other tags to format the content.
  
  // Other examples of common self closing tags: <hr>, <img>, <link> and <area>

  // How many lines of text will the following code create? -- 3
<p>
One <br />
Two <br />
Three
</p>
